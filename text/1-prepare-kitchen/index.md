# Setting Up Your Kitchen

Any experienced chef will tell you that cooking delicious blockchains... I mean meals... starts with a properly equipped and organized kitchen. In this chapter we will guide you through setting up your development environment, and introduce you to the structure of the recipes repository.

This section covers:

* [Building a Node](./1-build-node.md) - Compile and execute your first Substrate-based blockchain node.
* [Interacting with the Node](./2-interact-node.md) - Submit transactions and inspect state with a user interface.
* [Understanding the Kitchen's Organization](./3-kitchen-organization.md) - How is the code organized, and why?
