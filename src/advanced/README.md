#  🎉Advanced Patterns 🐰🎊

This section will be replaced by three new sections:
1. [Safety and Optimization](../safety/README.md)
2. [DAO Design Patterns](../dao/README.md)
3. [Protocol Engineering](../proto/README.md)

I plan to make the formal transition once each section has at least 3 sections. This folder will now be used to plan possible future sections.

## Possible Future Sections

* Cryptography

* move Optimization into its own section (split from Safety)
